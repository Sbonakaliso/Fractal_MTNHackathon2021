### Team Name: Fractal
Team Fractal has one member (Sbonakaliso Kunene), who is new to mobile and android development.

### App Name: Class4iR
<b>Class4iR</b> is an offline classroom participation facilitator and progress tacker. The app changes the way learner participate in a classroom, from raising hands and answering questions to answering questions (poll-like) via their mobile devices. The old method of participation is very limited in that the teacher only gets one answer per question which isn't enough feedback and it also excludes shy learners. By answering via <b>Class4iR</b> learners will be able to answer questions without fear of humiliation in front of peers, and since learners will be answering concurrently it means that getting every single learner to participate in every single question becomes feasible.
